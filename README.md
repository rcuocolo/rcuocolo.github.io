Renato Cuocolo serves as a member of the European Society of Radiology (ESR) eHealth and Informatics Subcommittee, of the European Society of Medical Imaging Informatics (EuSoMII) Board, Young Club (as vice-Chair) and Scientific Committees and European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) Junior Network Committee. He is a researcher at the Augmented Reality for Health Monitoring Laboratory (ARHeMLab) of the University of Naples "Federico II" Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology. Renato Cuocolo has also participated in the European Network for Assessment of Imaging in Medicine (EuroAIM), a joint initiative of the European Institute for Biomedical Imaging Research (EIBIR). His research interests include radiomics and machine learning applications in medical imaging, especially musculoskeletal and genitourinary radiology. Editorial Board member for European Radiology, European Radiology Experimental, and European Journal of Radiology.
