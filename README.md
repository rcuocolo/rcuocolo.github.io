## Repositories

- [PROSTATEx lesion masks](https://github.com/rcuocolo/PROSTATEx_masks)  
Results of a quality check on the PROSTATEx public prostate cancer MRI database. The repository contains high-quality lesion masks annotated by expert radiologists in consensus. Its aim is to improve the quality of the dataset and of research conducted on it and provide a template for similar efforts in other public medical imaging datasets [(Project Page)](https://rcuocolo.github.io/PROSTATEx_masks/)
- [Cartilaginous tumor CT classification model](https://github.com/rcuocolo/csa_ct)  
Model data developed in WEKA for the classification of cartilaginous tumors on CT images. Includes all necessary files and information to reproduce the entire pipeline. [(Project Page)](https://rcuocolo.github.io/csa_ct/)
- [Cartilaginous tumor MRI classification model](https://github.com/rcuocolo/mri_act_cs2)  
MRI radiomics and machine learning model to classify atypical cartilaginous tumor and G2 chondrosarcoma. Includes all necessary files and information to reproduce the entire pipeline. [(Project Page)](https://rcuocolo.github.io/mri_act_cs2/)
- [Endometrial cancer MRI classification model](https://github.com/rcuocolo/MRadEC)
